This project has been a labor of love for over a decade. Along the way, many people have contributed in ways that are both big and small. While not everyone mentioned here will be listed on the official film credits, we want to recognize their efforts and thank them for helping us make this dream a reality.

### To Our Backers

First and foremost, we would like to thank our 170 Kickstarter backers. This film would never have been possible without their financial and emotional support. It was due to their generosity that we were able to fly to El Salvador and capture these unforgettable moments.
