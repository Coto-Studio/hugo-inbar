In 2011, sixteen years after reuniting with his family, Nelson/Roberto gets invited to El Salvador's Day of the Disappeared, where the country's president might acknowledge their existence for the first time in the nation's history.

The event, which is taking place nearly two decades after the end of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the Cold War, could be a turning point for the country. 

Despite the skepticism voiced by some attendees, Nelson/Roberto is hopeful that the government will take meaningful action to help the families of the Disappeared, who are still searching for answers about their loved ones.

During the week-long trip, We interviewed my family about their experiences during the war and other Salvadorans who had also been forcibly separated from their families as children.

The trip's highlight was interviewing Suyapa Cruz, a civil rights hero whose court case led to the creation of the Day of the Disappeared Children.
