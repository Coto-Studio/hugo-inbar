In 1997, Nelson de Witt, a 16-year-old adoptee from Boston, Massachusetts, discovered that he had been identified as one Roberto Coto, an infant who vanished in 1982 after a deadly government raid on a guerrilla safe house in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

Along with Roberto, the raid resulted in the forced disappearance of a dozen Salvadoran revolutionaries, including his biological mother, _Ana Milagro Escobar_.

After a tearful reunion, where he met his birth father, siblings, and grandmother, Mam√° Chila, Nelson/Roberto began a decades-long search to understand what happened to him and his family during the war.
