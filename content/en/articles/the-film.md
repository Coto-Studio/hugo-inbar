In 2011, sixteen years after reuniting with his family, Nelson/Roberto was invited to El Salvador's Day of the Disappeared, where the country's president acknowledged their existence for the first time in the nation's history.

During the week-long trip, We interviewed my family about their experiences during the war and other Salvadorans who had also been forcibly separated from their families as children.

The highlight of the trip was interviewing Suyapa Cruz, a civil rights hero whose court case led to the creation of the Day of the Disappeared Children.
